      <p>[MUSIC ]\n\nIf your team uses video, you need Wistia. Let
      me show you why. I'm Chris from Wistia, and in this demo, we'll cover
      managing your video content are fast, reliable, accessible, and fully
      customizable video player creating curated video collections.\n\nOur live
      event platform which helps you host awesome, engaging webinars. Wistia is
      world famous video analytics, recording and editing tools made for anyone
      at any skill level and the other tools that Wistia integrates with. So
      let's dive in to the wonderful world of Wistia.\n\nIf you're working with
      video, you need a place where your content lives. So you can easily embed
      it on your website, share it with a collaborator or a client, or publish
      it to another platform like LinkedIn or YouTube. And that's where Wistia
      comes in. Upload your video and Wistia will automatically prepare it for
      smooth, high quality playback on any device.\n\nNow every uploaded video
      is automatically transcribed, making your content more accessible and more
      searchable. You can even add AI generated video descriptions and AI
      generated captions with one click. Pretty nifty.\n\nManaging and storing
      all of your video content is a breeze. Organize your videos into folders,
      and create subfolders, add tags to keep things tidy. And with universal
      search, you can find any video in your library in no time.\n\nWe know not
      every video should be seen or accessed by everyone, so our comprehensive
      user permission options help you invite team members to manage your
      account and lets you invite collaborators or customers outside of your
      organization to privately view videos.\n\nWistia makes it easy to replace
      a video too. Which is perfect if you want to update a video without having
      to embed it everywhere. And if you're just making a small tweak to your
      video, you can choose to keep the existing analytics or start
      fresh.\n\nAnd if you're ready to retire a video but you don't want to
      delete it from your account, you can archive it. As a video producer, I
      love being able to use Wistia to collaborate.\n\nShare for review makes it
      easy to collect feedback right on your video. Time coded comments and
      threaded replies keep everything organized and in context so reviews stay
      on track and approvals move much faster.\n\nAnd you can request a video
      which allows others to upload or record videos directly into your account.
      Now, this is perfect for gathering testimonials or collecting videos from
      multiple people.\n\nWistia is the video platform that knows business. And
      we have some pretty fancy tricks up our sleeve to help your videos do more
      than just play.\n\nAt the core of Wistia, is the Wistia player. And we're
      proud to say it's the fastest, lightest, most accessible video player on
      the market.\n\nStart by customizing the Wistia video player to ensure your
      videos look and feel like your brand. You can do all sorts of things
      adjust colors, add rounded corners, and even apply a gradient overlay to
      match your aesthetic. There are also some pretty handy marketing tools you
      can use to really put your videos to work. Our email collector has to be
      one of my favorites.\n\nWistia lets you add a form right into your video
      that'll show up anywhere the video is playing. It's a great tool for gated
      content like on demand webinar recordings. Want to direct viewers to an
      external link, easy to do with Wistia annotation tool.\n\nEnd your video
      with a call to action that moves your audience. Whether it's signing up,
      booking a demo, or diving into more content. Our timeline view lets you
      dial in exactly where those interactive elements appear in your
      video.\n\nWistia automatically transcribes your video so you can turn on
      captions, with the option to upgrade to a human verified transcription
      too. Now, viewers can adjust font, size, and color for better readability.
      And with the click of a button, you can order audio descriptions, making
      your content accessible to as many folks as possible.\n\nReach a global
      audience with AI powered dubbing that translates your videos into over 50
      languages, syncing lip movements for a magical result. Like
      this.\n\n[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\n\nPretty cool, huh? And with customizations
      like password protection, Wistia keeps you in total control of the viewing
      experience. Wistia will even automatically generate AI chapters to help
      viewers find the content they need quickly.\n\nOnce your video is looking
      good, it's easy to get it onto your website. Just copy a snippet of code
      and paste it onto your site.\n\nYou can choose between a standard inline
      embed or a pop over embed. And no matter which type you choose, the embed
      will be responsive.\n\nOnce your video is embedded on your site, any
      future changes and customizations you make in Wistia will automatically be
      updated on your site. And with SEO benefits built in, Wistia can help your
      videos rank better on Google Search.\n\nIf you're watching this, you're
      serious about video. And if you're serious about video, I'll bet you're
      sitting on a gold mine of valuable content to share.\n\nThat's where
      collections come in. With Wistia, you can organize videos and podcasts
      into beautifully branded experiences, playlists, channels, carousels,
      podcasts.\n\nCollections come in a bunch of different flavors. And getting
      them on your site is as simple as copy and pasting a snippet of code. Each
      collection is easy to customize. Choose your layout, add your logo and
      branding, tweak the font and color, and get it looking exactly how you
      want.\n\nAnd anytime you drop a new video into your folder, your
      collection will automatically update. Collections work great for podcasts
      to upload audio files, create a branded podcast page, and use the same
      analytics and lead capture tools as video.\n\nWistia analytics, this is
      the good stuff. This is where you can really show the impact of your
      videos.\n\nFor every video or group of videos, it's easy to see important
      information at a glance. Like plays, average engagement, time spent, and
      top videos.\n\nIf you're promoting video content, it's also easy to see
      where traffic is coming from. Including which sources like UTM parameters
      are driving the most views and engagement. It's also easy to get deep
      insights on every video's performance.\n\nThis is an engagement graph, it
      shows you how your audience is interacting with your video. A spike like
      this means that viewers are rewatching, but a nasty drop off like this
      means you've lost your audience's attention.\n\nWistia also tracks how
      every person watches your video second by second. This is the view stream,
      which is a live look at how folks are watching all of your videos. Each
      video view has its own heat map, showing what each viewer watched,
      rewatched, or skipped over in your video.\n\nAudience analytics offer
      insights into viewer demographics and behavior, helping you tailor your
      content effectively. Wistia's analytics are built to help you better
      understand how your content is performing, what's working best, and where
      you might be able to improve.\n\nWistia makes hosting super engaging
      webinars, super easy.\n\nGive it a title, a date, and a description. You
      can even generate one with AI, then brand it your way. Add your logo,
      colors and a custom form to build a slick registration page.\n\nAnd yes,
      you can use a prebuilt form from your favorite marketing automation
      platform too. As people sign up, Wistia sends those leads straight into
      your marketing tools.\n\nInvite co-hosts and panelists, utilize dynamic
      layouts, screen sharing and backstage chat to keep your events
      professional and interactive. You can present a slide deck or play back
      other videos from your Wistia account.\n\nAfter the event, recordings are
      automatically saved in your Wistia account ready for editing and
      re-purposing. Gain deep insights with attendee analytics, including watch
      time chat activity, poll responses and CTA clicks. All of this data syncs
      with your marketing tech stack, enabling personalized follow ups and
      improved lead scoring.\n\nCreating polished video content shouldn't
